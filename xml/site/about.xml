			<p>Phoebius is PHP5 framework for complex web-services.</p>

			<p> It's goal is to minimize the risks and costs of software development by shifting the
				developers attention to the context of application logic. You you need is to define
				a project domain and then apply a programming code against it. The bootstrapping,
				mapping, testing and deployment is carried by the framework thus cutting the number
				of potential inconsistencies. Nevertheless, having a truly object-oriented
				architecture, Phoebius provides an ability to configure and re-implement an
				interface of at least any application layer within the control flow stack.</p>
			
			<p> Phoebius framework is the best choice for the basis of long-run web applications
				that meant to be deployed on high-loaded servers and should be scalable enough to
				meet the requirements of extremely-changing real world. </p>

			<p> Phoebius framework is an open-source project, published under the terms of 
				the <link to="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt">LGPL</link>. </p>
