	<title>About Phoebius Framework</title>
	<contents>
		<p>Phoebius is PHP5 framework for complex web-services.</p>

		<p> It's goal is the minimization of risks and costs of software development by shifting the
			developers' attention to the context of application logic. You just define a project
			domain and then apply the programming code against it. The bootstrapping, mapping,
			testing and deployment is carried by the framework thus cutting the number of potential
			inconsistencies. Nevertheless, having a truly object-oriented architecture, Phoebius
			provides an ability to configure and re-implement an interface of at least any
			application layer within the framework stack. </p>

		<p> Phoebius framework is an open-source project, published under the terms of the LGPL. </p>
