			<p>Phoebius is PHP5 framework for building complex web-services.</p>

			<p> It's goal is to minimize the risks and costs of software development by shifting the
				developers attention to the context of application logic. All you need is to define
				a project domain and then apply a programming code against it. The bootstrapping,
				mapping, testing and deployment is carried by the framework internals thus cutting
				the number of potential inconsistencies. Nevertheless, having a truly
				object-oriented architecture, Phoebius provides an ability to configure and
				re-implement an interface of at least any application layer within the control flow
				stack.</p>
			
			<p> Phoebius framework is the best choice as the basis of long-run web applications that
				meant to be scalable enough to meet the requirements of extremely-changing real
				world. </p>
			
			<p> Phoebius framework is an open-source project, published under the terms of 
				the <link to="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt">LGPL</link>. </p>
